# ReactLearning
A project where I am learning how to master ReactJS. The goal is to have knowledge of ReactJS and it's component based architecture, with tools such as webpack, webpack-dev-server, lintJs .. and other loaders.

This should be as simple as pulling down the code... doing an "npm install" and then "npm run dev".

The goal of this project is to have a navbar, which will know if a user is logged in or not. If the user is not logged in, the navbar will offer a Login button, or register button. If the user is then logged in, the navbar will offer 'My Profile' or other user privilaged options.

The goal is also to apply Lint (JSLint), and make the project well written based on rules.
