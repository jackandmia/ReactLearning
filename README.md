# ReactLearning
A project where I am learning how to master ReactJS. The goal is to have knowledge of ReactJS and it's component based architecture, with tools such as webpack, webpack-dev-server, lintJs .. and other loaders.

This should be as simple as pulling down the code... doing an "npm install" and then "npm run dev".
